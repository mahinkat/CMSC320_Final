## Contributions
**A: Project Idea:**  
Richeek, Jayden, Nathan, and Mahin decided on analyzing an NBA dataset.

**B: Dataset Curation and Preprocessing:**  
Richeek and Jayden converted the dataset into a Pandas dataframe, filtered empty rows, and dropped irrelevant columns.

**C: Data Exploration and Summary Statistics:**  
Richeek analyzed simple statistics. Nathan conducted a chi-squared test on shooting efficiency and player court time. Owen did an ANOVA on Points Scored by Team. Mahin did a Z-Test for High-Defense Players Points.

**D: ML Algorithm Design/Development:**  
Richeek and Jayden used the elbow method for K-Means clustering on points, assists, steals, rebounds, blocks, and field goal percentage.

**E: ML Algorithm Training and Test Data Analysis:**  
Nathan and Alex reviewed models and data. Nathan performed testing and analysis for K-Means clustering.

**F: Visualization, Result Analysis, Conclusion:**  
Richeek and Jayden visualized the Elbow method and clustering results. Nathan analyzed and visualized clusters.

**G: Final Tutorial Report Creation:**  
Jayden wrote the Contributions and Parts of the Introduction.
